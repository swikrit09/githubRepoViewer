# GitHub Repository Viewer

The GitHub Repository Viewer is a web application that allows users to view public GitHub repositories for a specific user. This project utilizes the GitHub REST API to fetch and display repository data, and features server-side pagination, dynamic content loading, and an optional search bar for filtering repositories.

## Features

- **Server-side Pagination**: Users can navigate through pages of repositories.
- **Dynamic Repository Per Page Selection**: Users can choose the number of repositories to display per page (options include 10, 20, 50, or 100).
- **Search Functionality**: An optional search bar allows users to filter the displayed repositories by name.
- **Responsive UI**: Designed to be responsive, providing a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.

## Running the Project Locally

To run the GitHub Repository Viewer locally, simply follow these steps:

1. Download the project files to your local machine. This can be done in two ways:
   - **Option 1**: Use the `Download ZIP` button on the GitHub repository page.
   - **Option 2**: Clone the repository using Git:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/swikrit09/githubRepoViewer.git
     ```

2. Extract the ZIP file (if downloaded as a ZIP).

3. Navigate to the extracted project directory.

4. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

No additional installation is required, and there is no need to start a server. The project runs entirely on client-side technologies.

## How to Use

After opening the `index.html` file in your web browser:

1. Enter a GitHub username into the input field provided on the page.

2. Click the "Load Repositories" button to display the repositories.

3. Use the pagination controls to navigate between pages of repositories.

4. Optionally, use the dropdown menu to select how many repositories to display per page.

5. If needed, use the search bar to filter the displayed repositories.
